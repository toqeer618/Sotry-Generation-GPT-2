# Sotry-Generation-GPT-2
Deep learning is advancing rapidly in the fields of text abstraction and dialogue generation. There is still a lot of research being done in the field of long-standing story-generation. Deep learning methods are gradually being used to create new research hotspots in the field of text generation when it comes to traditional story generation. In the field of story generation, techniques such as seq2seq are incapable of providing accurate long-distance text modelling. In order to solve the story-generation task and solve coherency and vividness, the relationship between the long text and the short text should be considered. Much research has been conducted in order to improve modelling methods. We will use deep learning models such as Bert, GPT, and LSTM in this project. Weâ€™ll compare the results of all of these models to see which one does a better job of generating stories from a sequence of words. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed approaches will be evaluated using popular machine translation and summarization evaluation metrics on a publicly available dataset. Our system will be able to generate new stories based on event information phrases.
